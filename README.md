### About Me
Yo! I'm DTOG, a amateur Python developer.
• I live in Atlanta, Georgia, US
• I am administrator on a ~~shitty~~ cool Discord server.
• I'm half-Arab and half-German even if I live in the states.
### Coding Information
• I mostly specialize in Discord bots.
• I'm part of the TBKBot Development Team.
• I code all of my Discord bots in discord.py.
• My current WIP project is Discord Bot Library, a bot that serves as an all-in-one bot and a coding base/lesson bot.
